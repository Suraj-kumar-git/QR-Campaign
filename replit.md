## Database Migration to In-Memory Storage

### **Why We Switched from Neon Database to In-Memory Storage**

Originally, the platform was designed to use **Neon (Serverless PostgreSQL)** as the production database. However, during development and for demonstration purposes, we migrated to **in-memory storage** using JavaScript Maps for the following reasons:

### **Technical Reasons**
- **Development Simplicity**: No need to manage database connections, schemas, or environment setup
- **Zero Configuration**: Eliminates the need for DATABASE_URL configuration and connection pooling
- **Instant Reset**: Application restart automatically resets to fresh sample data
- **No External Dependencies**: Removes dependency on external database services during development
- **Faster Development Cycle**: No database setup or migration steps required for new developers

### **Demonstration Benefits**
- **Consistent Sample Data**: Every restart provides the same comprehensive demo dataset
- **No Data Persistence Issues**: Eliminates potential data corruption or inconsistency during demos
- **Predictable State**: Always starts with known user accounts and campaign data
- **Easy Testing**: Fresh state for each testing session without cleanup procedures

### **Architecture Preservation**
Even with in-memory storage, we maintained:
- **Drizzle ORM Schema**: All table definitions and relationships preserved
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with database types
- **Query Interface**: Same CRUD operations and storage interface
- **Migration Ready**: Can easily switch back to PostgreSQL when needed

### **Sample Data Population**
The in-memory storage automatically populates with:
- **5 Users**: 1 admin (Suraj Kumar) and 4 regular users
- **29 Campaigns**: Diverse campaigns across different categories and users
- **270+ Scan Events**: Realistic analytics data with regional distribution
- **Mixed Statuses**: Both active and expired campaigns for comprehensive testing
